<h3>Hi! ðŸ‘‹<br>I'm Francesco LorÃ¨<br>a Data Scientist and RPA Developer</h3>

During my university studies and work experiences, I was able to get in touch with a lot of people of different cultures, languages and traditions and I grew in professional and personal point of view. I moved to Milan for the MSc for two years.

I have experience in collecting, transforming, and organizing data for analysis to help make informed decisions. I have experienco to standardize e optimize digital processes.
I am a passionate student of the world of technology and in particular of computer science and during my experiences, I have acquired an excellent understanding and proficiency of programming languages and platforms for effective data analyses and robotic process automation.

I like sports and I practised swimming at a competitive level for 10 years, until the end of high school. I learned how important commitment and determination are to achieve personal and teamâ€™s goals.
Through sports competitions, I learned how to manage moments of stress, and this turned out to be so useful in everyday life.
