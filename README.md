<h3>Hi! ðŸ‘‹<br>I'm Francesco LorÃ¨<br>a Data Scientist</h3>

I am a student enrolled in Master of Science in Data Analytics for Business at Cattolica del Sacro Cuore University in Milan. I graduated in Economics and Business at Aldo Moro University in Bari.

During my bachelorâ€™s degree experiences, I was able to get in touch with a lot of people of different cultures, languages and traditions and I grew in professional and personal point of view. Last year, after the graduation, I moved to Milan for the MSc, this was and is an important step of my life that allowed me to integrate in a big new city, despite the actual pandemic emergency.

I am a versatile individual with experience in collecting, transforming, and organizing data for analysis to help make informed decisions.
I am a passionate student of the world of technology and in particular of computer science and during
my university studies, I have acquired an excellent understanding and proficiency of programming languages and platforms for effective data analyses.

I like sports and I practised swimming at a competitive level from 10 years, until the end of high school, and I learned how important commitment and determination are to achieve personal and teamâ€™s goals.
Through sports competitions, I learned how to manage moments of stress, and this turned out to be so useful in everyday life.

I am looking for an opportunity that can allow me to put in practise and further improve what I learned so far. I believe a competitive and dynamic environment is ideal for me to continue my career and to
achieve my personal goals.

Should you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
